## <a name="about_me">ABOUT ME</a>
I'm working as a Software Tester, mostly manual one, but I like to automize tasks, whatever I can. I do it mostly to optimize my daily work and develop myself with automation tools. 
Why?
Because:
 - I like do things in a efficient way
 - I love to learn new things
 - I like to put a some effort to minimalize work to do in the future
